# O-output: Your Created Work

This is where everything your agents create goes.

> "Output is what the system does."

## Folder Structure

Organize your work in numbered folders:

```
O-output/
├── 01-linkedin-post-productivity/
│   ├── draft-v1.md
│   ├── draft-v2.md
│   └── draft-final.md
├── 02-twitter-thread-habits/
│   ├── copy-v1.md
│   └── copy-final.md
├── 03-newsletter-ai-agents/
│   └── draft-v1.md
└── README.md
```

---

## Naming Rules

### Folders
- Format: `[number]-[slug]`
- Example: `01-linkedin-post-productivity`
- Use sequential numbers
- Slugs should be descriptive but short

### Files Inside Folders
- Format: `[type]-v[number].md` or `[type]-final.md`
- Examples:
  - `draft-v1.md` — First draft
  - `draft-v2.md` — Second revision
  - `draft-final.md` — Approved version
  - `copy-v1.md` — First copy version
  - `review-notes.md` — Gatekeeper feedback

---

## Workflow

1. **Agent creates work** → Saves to `O-output/[project-folder]/draft-v1.md`
2. **Gatekeeper reviews** → Saves feedback or requests revision
3. **Agent revises** → Saves to `draft-v2.md`
4. **Approved** → Rename final version to `draft-final.md`
5. **You publish** → Mark folder as complete

---

## Important Rules

- **Never save files directly in `/O-output/`** — Always create a folder first
- **Version everything** — Keep drafts, don't overwrite
- **Final means approved** — Only use `-final` for approved work

---

## Getting Started

When you're ready to create content:

1. Create a folder: `01-[your-project-name]/`
2. Agent saves first draft: `draft-v1.md`
3. Review and iterate
4. Final version: `draft-final.md`
