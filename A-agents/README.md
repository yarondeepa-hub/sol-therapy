## How Agents Work Together

```
YOU (direction + final approval)

Copywriter Agent (creates content)
    ↓
Gatekeeper Agent (quality check)
    ↓
YOU (publish)
```

You are always the CEO. Agents execute. You decide.

## Adding New Agents

To add a new agent:

1. Create `[role]-agent.md` in this folder
2. Define their:
   - Core identity
   - Responsibilities
   - Required reading (what files they need)
   - Output format
   - Quality standards
3. Update the team hierarchy if needed

## Agent Required Reading

Every agent should read these before working:

**From C-core:**
- `C-core/project-brief.md` — What you do
- `C-core/voice-dna.md` — How you sound
- `C-core/icp-profile.md` — Who you serve

**From M-memory:**
- `M-memory/learning-log.md` — Past patterns and learnings
