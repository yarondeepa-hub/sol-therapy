# Writing Samples

Add your best content here. Agents will study these to match your voice.

---

## What to Include

- **5-10 pieces minimum** — More is better
- **Your best work** — Posts that "sound like you"
- **Variety** — Different topics, same voice
- **Engagement winners** — Content that performed well

---

## File Format

Save each sample as a separate `.md` file:
```
writing-samples/
├── README.md
├── linkedin-post-productivity.md
├── linkedin-post-ai-agents.md
├── newsletter-intro-sample.md
└── [your-samples].md
```

---

## Sample Format

```markdown
# [Title or Topic]

**Platform:** [LinkedIn / Twitter / Newsletter]
**Date:** [When it was published]
**Performance:** [Engagement stats if available]

---

[Paste your content here]

---

**Why this works:**
- [What makes this piece "you"]
- [What makes it effective]
```

---

## Why This Matters

Your agents need examples of your voice to replicate it.

Without samples, they'll default to generic copy.
With samples, they'll write like you.
