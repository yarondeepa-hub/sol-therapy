## Quick Start: Brand Discovery Worksheet

**Start here if you're new.**

1. Open `references/brand-discovery-worksheet.md`
2. Fill in the 10 questions (takes ~10 minutes)
3. Ask Claude to convert your answers into C-core files

This is the fastest way to populate your brand foundation.

## How Agents Use This

When creating content, agents will:
1. Check `research/` for relevant industry context
2. Study `references/writing-samples/` to match your voice
3. Reference `data/` for proof points and numbers

The more you feed the brain, the smarter your agents become.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Fill the brand discovery worksheet** — `references/brand-discovery-worksheet.md`
2. **Add writing samples** — Put 5-10 pieces in `references/writing-samples/`
3. **Include research** — Any industry data in `research/`
4. **Add audience data** — Analytics in `data/` if you have it
