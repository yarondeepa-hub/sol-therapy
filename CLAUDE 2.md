# AI Agent Team — Project Instructions

## Session Start Protocol (MANDATORY)

When starting ANY new conversation from this folder, ALWAYS read these files first before responding:

### 1. Core Files (C-core/)
- `C-core/project-brief.md` — What the business does
- `C-core/voice-dna.md` — How the brand speaks
- `C-core/icp-profile.md` — Who the target audience is

### 2. Memory Files (M-memory/)
- `M-memory/learning-log.md` — What we've learned together
- `M-memory/feedback.md` — Audience reactions and signals
- `M-memory/decisions.md` — Strategic choices made

### 3. Agent Definitions (A-agents/)
- `A-agents/copywriter-agent.md` — Content creation agent
- `A-agents/gatekeeper-agent.md` — Quality review agent

## How This Works

Claude Code automatically reads this file when you open a conversation from this folder.

The files above are your "memory" — they persist between sessions. When you update them, future sessions will have that context.

## Auto-Learning Protocol

After completing significant work, update the relevant memory file:

- **New insight about what works?** → Update `M-memory/learning-log.md`
- **Received feedback?** → Update `M-memory/feedback.md`
- **Made a strategic decision?** → Update `M-memory/decisions.md`

## Quick Commands

- "כתוב פוסט על [נושא]" — Creates content using your voice
- "תבדוק את האיכות" — Runs gatekeeper review
- "מה למדנו?" — Shows learning log summary
