## Illustrator Discoveries (Top 3)

### 1. CSGO: Content-Style Composition for Text-to-Image Generation

- **What:** A unified framework that explicitly decouples content and style features via independent injection, enabling image-driven style transfer, text-driven stylized synthesis, and text-editing-driven stylized synthesis in one architecture.
- **Why it matters:** This is exactly what we need for consistent Soul Therapy style. Instead of re-prompting every time, we could feed one reference image (our best sumi-e illustration) and get consistent stylization across all new generations. The IMAGStyle dataset of 210K content-style-stylized triplets is a breakthrough for training controllable style.

**Adoption Score: 20/25** -> **Trigger Experiment**

| Parameter | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Brand Fit | 5 | Perfect for our "consistent sumi-e aesthetic" problem |
| Leverage | 4 | Dramatic quality jump - one reference image = consistent style |
| Repeatability | 4 | Claims "any form of arbitrary style transfer without fine-tuning" |
| Workflow Export | 4 | Has GitHub repo, model weights on HuggingFace |
| Risk/License | 3 | Open source, but needs testing on our specific aesthetic |

**Recipe sketch:**
1. Select our best approved sumi-e illustration as style reference
2. Load CSGO model from HuggingFace
3. Test with 3 different content prompts (mountains, bamboo, waves)
4. Compare output consistency vs our current Gemini workflow
5. If successful: create Tool Card with exact parameters

### 2. Z-Image: Efficient 6B-Parameter Generation Model

- **What:** A 6B-parameter foundation model achieving SOTA results with only 8 inference steps. Z-Image-Turbo offers sub-second inference on H800 GPUs and fits in 16GB VRAM consumer devices.
- **Why it matters:** Our current nano-banana-pro via Gemini is good, but Z-Image's efficiency could mean faster iteration cycles and lower cost. The bilingual text rendering capability is interesting for potential Hebrew/English integration, though we avoid text in illustrations.
- **Source:** [GitHub - Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image](https://github.com/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22699)

**Adoption Score: 14/25** -> **Parking Lot**

| Parameter | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Brand Fit | 3 | General purpose - not specifically tuned for our aesthetic |
| Leverage | 3 | Speed gain, but not dramatic quality jump |
| Repeatability | 3 | New model, less tested than current workflow |
| Workflow Export | 3 | Has ComfyUI workflow, but not on Replicate yet |
| Risk/License | 2 | Alibaba/Tongyi - license unclear for commercial use |

**Why parked:** Not a clear enough improvement over our current Gemini workflow. Worth revisiting when it appears on Replicate with clear licensing.

### 3. DiffArtist (Artist): Training-Free Aesthetic Stylization Control

- **What:** A training-free method that disentangles content and style denoising into separate diffusion processes while sharing information. Allows user control over "abstractness" including stroke, shape, and color.
- **Why it matters:** The "stroke control" dimension is exactly what we struggle with - getting visible brushwork that feels handmade, not AI-generated. The training-free aspect means no fine-tuning needed.
- **Source:** [GitHub - songrise/Artist](https://github.com/songrise/Artist) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15842)

**Adoption Score: 17/25** -> **Weekly Lab Queue**

| Parameter | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Brand Fit | 4 | "Stroke control" directly addresses our texture needs |
| Leverage | 3 | Moderate - works on existing diffusion models |
| Repeatability | 4 | Published at ACM MM 2025, well-documented |
| Workflow Export | 3 | GitHub repo, but integration work needed |
| Risk/License | 3 | Academic release, needs testing with our models |

**Recipe sketch:**
1. Clone Artist repo
2. Test with Flux as base model
3. Experiment with stroke/shape/color sliders on mountain scene
4. Document parameter ranges that match our "visible brushwork" requirement

## CTO Discoveries (Top 3)

### 1. Astro 6 + Cloudflare Integration: Unified Dev/Prod Runtime

- **What:** Astro 6 collapses the gap between dev and production with new Vite Environment API integration. The Astro team has joined Cloudflare, and Astro 6 includes workerd integration for edge deployment.
- **Why it matters:** Our current stack uses vanilla HTML/CSS/JS deployed to Netlify. Astro 6 would give us: component islands for interactivity, better build tooling, and a clear migration path to edge if needed. The "boring technology" answer: we might not need it. Our current setup works.
- **Source:** [Astro 6 Beta](https://astro.build/blog/astro-6-beta/) | [Cloudflare Announcement](https://blog.cloudflare.com/astro-joins-cloudflare/)

**Adoption Score: 15/25** -> **Parking Lot**

| Parameter | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Brand Fit | 3 | Content-driven sites are Astro's strength |
| Leverage | 3 | Better DX, but our current workflow is fine |
| Repeatability | 4 | Mature framework, well-documented |
| Workflow Export | 3 | Migration work required |
| Risk/License | 2 | Breaking changes in v6 (Node 22+, removed APIs) |

**Why parked:** Violates today's CTO question - "What boring technology could replace our most complex current solution?" Our current vanilla HTML/CSS/JS IS the boring technology. Adding Astro would add complexity, not remove it. Revisit only if we need component islands or SSR.

### 2. CSS Scroll-Driven Animations: Native Baseline 2026

- **What:** `animation-timeline: scroll()` and `view()` are expected to reach cross-browser baseline in 2026 with Firefox and Safari shipping full support. Scroll-triggered reveals, progress bars, parallax - all without JavaScript.
- **Why it matters:** We currently use GSAP ScrollTrigger for all scroll animations. Native CSS would mean zero JavaScript for most scroll effects, smaller bundle, and better performance. But GSAP gives us more control.
- **Source:** [web.dev New Features](https://web.dev/blog/web-platform-01-2026) | [modern.css](https://modern-css.com/whats-new-in-css-2026/)

**Adoption Score: 16/25** -> **Weekly Lab Queue**

| Parameter | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Brand Fit | 3 | Our subtle scroll animations would work natively |
| Leverage | 4 | Remove GSAP for simple effects = smaller bundle |
| Repeatability | 3 | Browser support not yet universal |
| Workflow Export | 4 | Pure CSS - direct into our stylesheet |
| Risk/License | 2 | Firefox/Safari support coming, not stable yet |

**Recipe sketch:**
1. Identify 3 simple ScrollTrigger animations on our site
2. Rewrite each using native `animation-timeline: scroll()`
3. Test across browsers
4. Document which effects can go native vs which need GSAP

### 3. Claude Code --worktree Mode + LSP Tool

- **What:** Claude Code now supports isolated git worktrees for safer agent operations, and an LSP tool for go-to-definition, find-references, and hover documentation without reading entire files.
- **Why it matters:** The LSP tool could dramatically reduce our context usage when exploring codebases. Instead of reading whole files, we could jump to specific definitions. The worktree mode would let us run experiments without polluting our main branch.
- **Source:** [Claude Code Changelog](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) | [Releasebot Updates](https://releasebot.io/updates/anthropic/claude-code)

**Adoption Score: 18/25** -> **Weekly Lab Queue**

| Parameter | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Brand Fit | 4 | Directly improves our Sol Therapy agent workflow |
| Leverage | 4 | Worktree isolation = safer experiments |
| Repeatability | 4 | Official Anthropic feature, well-supported |
| Workflow Export | 4 | Already in our environment |
| Risk/License | 2 | Research preview for some features |

**Recipe sketch:**
1. Test `--worktree` flag on a Sol Therapy code task
2. Experiment with LSP tool for codebase exploration
3. Document which scenarios benefit most
4. Update CLAUDE.md with new workflow patterns if useful

## Cross-Pollination: Ceramics

**Artist/Technique:** Jun Kaneko - Dango Series

**What caught attention:** Kaneko uses masking tape and colored slips to create bold graphic motifs on organic ceramic forms, and deliberately allows glazes to run and drip, incorporating "imperfections" that happen during firing. His Dangos are 1,500-pound egg-shaped forms with lines, bars, polka dots, spirals.

**Translation to our work:**
- **Prompt modifier:** "controlled drips and runs where glaze meets paper, embracing kiln accidents"
- **Composition rule:** Kaneko's approach to scale ("each form has one right scale") mirrors our "one focal subject" rule
- **Technique:** His masking tape technique = our "negative space as intentional design" principle
- **Philosophy:** "Imperfections that happen in production" = our wabi-sabi token

**Concrete application:** Next time we generate an ink wash illustration, add to prompt: "allow controlled ink bleeding at edges, embrace paper texture irregularities, one organic form as single focal point"

**Adoption Score: 17/25** -> **Weekly Lab Queue**

| Parameter | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Brand Fit | 5 | Perfect wabi-sabi philosophy match |
| Leverage | 3 | Concept translation, not tool |
| Repeatability | 4 | Clear prompt modifiers to test |
| Workflow Export | 3 | Requires prompt engineering work |
| Risk/License | 2 | Indirect inspiration, no IP concerns |

## Surprise Slot

**What made me stop:** The "Boring Technology" Movement in 2026 Web Dev

A senior engineer wrote about moving from microservices and Kubernetes to a monolithic architecture on a single VPS with SQLite, arguing most applications don't need distributed systems complexity.

**Why this matters for Sol Therapy:**

We've been thinking about adding complexity (Astro, CMS, edge functions). But our current stack - vanilla HTML/CSS/JS on Netlify - is the "boring technology" that works. No build step. No framework lock-in. No node_modules. Direct file editing.

Today's CTO question asks "What boring technology could replace our most complex current solution?" The answer might be: **we already have it.** Our complexity is in the agent workflow, not the code. That's the right place for complexity to live.

**Source:** [My 2026 Tech Stack is Boring as Hell](https://app.daily.dev/posts/my-2026-tech-stack-is-boring-as-hell-and-that-is-the-point--zw58f0sjv)

**Contrarian insight:** Don't add Astro. Don't add a CMS. Our vanilla HTML/CSS/JS is a feature, not a bug. The agent workflow handles the complexity; the code stays dumb and reliable.

## Saul Bass Question: What Would He Do With AI?

Saul Bass's design principles:
- "Symbolize and summarize" - reduce complex ideas to powerful visuals
- Bold geometric shapes as characters in visual stories
- Limited color palettes (red, black, white dominance)
- Strong negative space
- Dynamic diagonal lines creating movement
- Retro futurism meets contemporary digital

**AI Prompt Translation for Soul Therapy:**

If Saul Bass designed our illustrations, he would:
1. **Reduce:** One mountain becomes one triangle with texture
2. **Symbolize:** Meditation becomes a single circle (enso) or seated silhouette
3. **Limit:** Drop to 2-3 colors per illustration
4. **Move:** Add implied movement through diagonal composition
5. **Title sequence thinking:** Each illustration as a frame in a story

**Test prompt (for Weekly Lab):**
"Saul Bass style meditation poster, single geometric mountain form as triangle, limited to indigo and warm cream paper, strong diagonal composition, bold negative space, retro futurist zen aesthetic, no text, warm paper texture visible"

This is a departure from our current sumi-e approach but might work for specific applications (event posters, social media graphics).

## Parking Lot Additions

### Z-Image (Score: 14/25, Date: 2026-02-20)
- What: Efficient 6B-parameter image generation model
- Why parked: Not on Replicate, unclear licensing for commercial use
- Revisit trigger: When it appears on Replicate with clear license

### Astro 6 (Score: 15/25, Date: 2026-02-20)
- What: Framework with Cloudflare integration, unified dev/prod runtime
- Why parked: Violates "boring technology" principle - adds complexity we don't need
- Revisit trigger: If we need component islands, SSR, or edge computing

---

## Scout's Opinion

**Strongest find today:** CSGO for style transfer. If it works as advertised, this solves our "consistent Soul Therapy aesthetic" problem that we've been fighting with prompt engineering. One reference image instead of hoping the model understands "sumi-e with these specific characteristics."

**What I'd skip:** Z-Image. It's technically impressive but doesn't solve a problem we have. Our current Gemini workflow is good enough.

**Surprise value:** The "boring technology" article. It's not a tool or technique - it's a mindset check. We were about to add complexity (considering Astro, CMS). This is a reminder that our vanilla stack is a feature.

**Question for Yaron:** Would you be interested in testing a Saul Bass-inspired approach for specific use cases (posters, social graphics)? It's a departure from sumi-e but might work for certain applications.
