## Morning Scout 2026-02-20 - Complete

**Report saved to:** `T-tools/learning/morning-reports/2026-02-20-scout.md`

### Today's Questions (Day 1/30)
- **Illustrator:** What would Saul Bass do with AI image generation?
- **CTO:** What boring technology could replace our most complex current solution?

### Top Finding - Trigger Experiment Required

**CSGO: Content-Style Composition (Score: 20/25)**
A framework that decouples content and style via independent feature injection. Feed one reference image (your best sumi-e), get consistent stylization across all generations. Could solve the "consistent Soul Therapy aesthetic" problem.

### Lab Queue (Friday)
1. CSGO style transfer - **Trigger Experiment TODAY**
2. Claude Code --worktree + LSP (18/25)
3. DiffArtist stroke control (17/25)
4. Jun Kaneko prompt modifiers (17/25)
5. CSS Scroll-Driven Animations (16/25)

### Cross-Pollination: Jun Kaneko (Ceramics)
His masking tape technique and deliberate "kiln accidents" map directly to our wabi-sabi aesthetic. Prompt modifier: "allow controlled ink bleeding at edges, embrace paper texture irregularities"

### Surprise Slot
"Boring Technology" movement - a reminder that your vanilla HTML/CSS/JS stack is a feature, not a bug. Don't add Astro or a CMS. The agent workflow handles complexity; the code stays dumb and reliable.

### Parking Lot Additions
- Z-Image (14/25) - efficient but not on Replicate
- Astro 6 (15/25) - adds complexity we don't need

**Question for you:** Should I run the CSGO Trigger Experiment now (check availability, test with a Soul Therapy reference image)?
