It's time for my weekly content review. Please help me analyze and learn from this week.

Week of: [e.g., "January 20-26, 2025"]
Content I published this week: [list your posts/newsletters/content OR say "check O-output/ for recent files"]
Any notable wins: [e.g., "Post went viral", "Got 50 new followers", "Great comments"]
Any challenges: [e.g., "Low engagement on Tuesday's post", "Ran out of ideas", "None"]

Please run my weekly review:

1. First, read context files:
   - M-memory/learning-log.md (previous learnings)
   - M-memory/feedback.md (audience feedback)
   - C-core/project-brief.md (to assess alignment)

2. Content Performance Analysis:
   - Review content created this week (check O-output/ folders)
   - What themes/topics did I cover?
   - What formats did I use?
   - What performed well (based on my notes)?
   - What underperformed?

3. Pattern Recognition:
   - What type of content resonated most?
   - What hooks worked best?
   - What posting times/days worked?
   - Any audience feedback patterns?

4. Learnings to Capture:
   - What should I do MORE of?
   - What should I do LESS of?
   - What should I EXPERIMENT with?
   - Any new ideas that emerged?

5. Update Memory Files:

   **M-memory/learning-log.md:**
   - Add entry for this week
   - Document what worked and what didn't
   - Note any voice/style refinements

   **M-memory/feedback.md:**
   - Add any notable comments or DMs
   - Document audience reactions

## The Compound Effect

Weekly reviews seem small, but over time they:
- Build a knowledge base of what works FOR YOU
- Refine your voice through conscious iteration
- Prevent repeating the same mistakes
- Create momentum through documented progress

**Month 1:** You notice story posts get more comments
**Month 2:** You refine your story-telling format
**Month 3:** Story posts become your signature
**Month 6:** You're known for your stories
