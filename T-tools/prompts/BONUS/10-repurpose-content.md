Use this to turn one piece of content into multiple formats and platforms.

Copy and paste this into your chat (paste your original content):

```
I want to repurpose the following content into multiple formats:

---
ORIGINAL CONTENT:
[PASTE YOUR CONTENT HERE - can be a LinkedIn post, newsletter, podcast transcript, video script, blog post, etc.]

Original platform: [e.g., "LinkedIn post", "Newsletter", "Podcast episode"]
---

Please help me repurpose this into:

1. First, read my brand context:
   - C-core/voice-dna.md (to maintain consistent voice)
   - C-core/icp-profile.md (to adjust for different platforms)

2. Create adapted versions for these platforms (skip any that don't apply):

   **LinkedIn Post:**
   - Hook that stops the scroll
   - Condensed version optimized for LinkedIn
   - Engagement-focused CTA

   **Twitter/X Thread:**
   - Break into 5-10 tweet thread
   - Each tweet should stand alone AND flow together
   - Include a "save this thread" CTA

   **Newsletter Section:**
   - Expanded version with more depth
   - Personal angle/story addition
   - Clear takeaway or action item

   **Short-form Video Script (Reels/TikTok/Shorts):**
   - 30-60 second script
   - Strong hook in first 3 seconds
   - Visual/action suggestions

   **Carousel/Slide Deck:**
   - 6-10 slides
   - One key point per slide
   - Headline + supporting text format

3. For each version:
   - Adapt the tone for that platform's audience
   - Optimize length and format
   - Include platform-specific best practices

4. Save all versions to a new folder in O-output/

5. Update M-memory/learning-log.md with insights about repurposing

Show me all the repurposed versions and highlight what you changed for each platform.
