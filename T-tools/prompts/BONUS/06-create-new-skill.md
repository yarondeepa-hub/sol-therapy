I want to create a new skill for my agents. Here's what I need:

---
Skill name: [e.g., "newsletter-skill", "email-sequence-skill", "twitter-thread-skill"]
What it teaches: [What should agents learn from this skill?]
When to use: [In what situations should agents use this skill?]
---

Please do the following:

1. First, study the existing skills to understand the structure and style:
   - Read T-tools/skills/linkedin-post-skill/linkedin-post-skill.md
   - Read T-tools/skills/twitter-thread-skill/twitter-thread-skill.md
   - Notice the format: frontmatter, when to use, basics, structures, rules, templates, checklists

2. Read the brand core so the skill aligns with the brand:
   - C-core/project-brief.md
   - C-core/voice-dna.md
   - C-core/icp-profile.md

3. Create a new folder in T-tools/skills/ with the skill name (e.g., T-tools/skills/newsletter-skill/)

4. Create the skill file inside that folder (e.g., newsletter-skill.md):
   - Use the same structure as existing skills
   - Include frontmatter (name, description)
   - Add "When to Use" section
   - Explain the basics of this content type
   - Provide proven structures and templates
   - Include writing rules specific to this format
   - Add quality checklist
   - Include examples of good and bad practices

5. Update A-agents/copywriter-agent.md:
   - Add the new skill to the list of skills the copywriter should read when relevant
   - Add any specific instructions for using this skill

6. Update M-memory/learning-log.md:
   - Add an entry documenting the new skill
   - Note when agents should use it

7. Consider if we need a new workflow:
   - Should we create a workflow file in T-tools/workflows/ for this content type?
   - If yes, create it following the structure of linkedin-post-workflow.md

Show me the new skill file and confirm all updates are done.
