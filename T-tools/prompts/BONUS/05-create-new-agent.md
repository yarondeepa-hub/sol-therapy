I want to create a new agent for my team. Here's what I need:

---
Agent name: [e.g., "researcher", "editor", "social-media-manager"]
Main responsibility: [What should this agent do?]
When to use: [In what situations should this agent be activated?]
---

Please do the following:

1. First, study the existing agents to understand the structure and style:
   - Read A-agents/copywriter-agent.md
   - Read A-agents/gatekeeper-agent.md
   - Notice the format: frontmatter, core identity, required reading, checklists, output format

2. Read the brand core so the new agent knows the brand:
   - C-core/project-brief.md
   - C-core/voice-dna.md
   - C-core/icp-profile.md

3. Create the new agent file in A-agents/ folder:
   - Use the same structure as existing agents
   - Include frontmatter (name, description)
   - Define core identity and mission
   - Add "Required Reading" section pointing to relevant C-core and M-memory files
   - Create specific checklists for this agent's job
   - Define output format
   - Add collaboration instructions (who does this agent work with?)
   - End with the signature: > **© Tom Even**

4. Update M-memory/learning-log.md:
   - Add an entry documenting the new agent
   - Note its role and how it fits with the team

5. Update A-agents/gatekeeper-agent.md:
   - Add the new agent to the "Your Team" section if relevant
   - Define how Gatekeeper should review this agent's work (if applicable)

6. Consider if any workflows need updating:
   - Should this agent be part of the linkedin-post-workflow?
   - Should we create a new workflow for this agent?

Show me the new agent file and confirm all updates are done.
