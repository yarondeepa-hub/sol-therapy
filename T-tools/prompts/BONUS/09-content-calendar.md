I want to create a content calendar. Here are my parameters:

---
Time period: [e.g., "Next 2 weeks", "January 2025", "Q1"]
Posting frequency: [e.g., "3x per week on LinkedIn", "Daily on Twitter", "2 LinkedIn + 1 newsletter per week"]
Main themes/topics I want to cover: [e.g., "AI productivity, personal branding, workshop promotion"]
Upcoming events/launches: [e.g., "Workshop on Feb 15", "Product launch March 1", "None"]
---

Please help me:

1. First, read my brand context:
   - C-core/project-brief.md (what I do)
   - C-core/voice-dna.md (how I sound)
   - C-core/icp-profile.md (who I'm talking to)

2. Review my content pillars and themes to ensure variety

3. Create a content calendar with:
   - Date and day of week
   - Platform (LinkedIn, Twitter, Newsletter, etc.)
   - Content type (educational, story, promotional, engagement)
   - Topic/angle (specific enough to write from)
   - Hook idea or opening line
   - CTA (what action do I want readers to take?)

4. Format as a table I can easily reference

5. Balance the calendar:
   - Mix of content types (not all promotional)
   - Variety of topics within my pillars
   - Strategic placement of promotional content
   - Engagement posts for algorithm boost

6. Save the calendar to O-output/ with a descriptive folder name

7. Update M-memory/learning-log.md with any insights about content planning

Show me the calendar and explain your strategic thinking behind the content mix.

## When to Use This

- At the start of each month/quarter
- When you feel scattered about what to post
- Before a launch or event (to plan promotional content)
- When you want to batch-create content

## Pro Tips

1. **Plan around events** — If you have a workshop, plan content that builds toward it
2. **Mix content types** — 60% value, 30% engagement/story, 10% promotional
3. **Leave flexibility** — Don't over-plan; leave room for timely content
4. **Batch creation** — Use the calendar to write multiple posts in one session
