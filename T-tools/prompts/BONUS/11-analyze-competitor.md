I want to analyze a competitor's content to learn what works. Here are the details:

---
Competitor name/handle: [e.g., "@competitor", "Company Name", "Creator Name"]
Platform to analyze: [e.g., "LinkedIn", "Twitter", "Newsletter", "YouTube"]
Their LinkedIn/Twitter URL or website: [paste URL if available]
What they do: [brief description of their business/niche]
Why I'm interested: [e.g., "They have great engagement", "Similar audience to mine", "I admire their style"]
---

Please help me analyze their content:

1. First, read my brand context for comparison:
   - C-core/project-brief.md
   - C-core/voice-dna.md
   - C-core/icp-profile.md

2. Content Analysis (based on their recent posts):

   **Format Analysis:**
   - What content formats do they use most?
   - Average post length?
   - How often do they post?
   - Visual elements (images, carousels, videos)?

   **Hook Analysis:**
   - What types of hooks do they use?
   - Pattern in their opening lines?
   - What emotional triggers appear?

   **Topic Analysis:**
   - What themes do they cover repeatedly?
   - What content pillars can you identify?
   - What topics get most engagement?

   **Engagement Patterns:**
   - What posts get most likes/comments?
   - What generates discussion vs. passive likes?
   - How do they encourage engagement?

   **Voice & Style:**
   - How would you describe their voice?
   - What makes them distinctive?
   - Sentence structure patterns?

3. Create actionable insights:
   - What can I learn from their approach?
   - What could I do differently/better?
   - What tactics could I test?
   - What should I NOT copy (doesn't fit my brand)?

4. Generate 3-5 content ideas inspired by (but not copying) their best work

5. Save the analysis to B-brain/research/ as a competitor analysis file

6. Update M-memory/learning-log.md with key learnings

Show me the full analysis and highlight the most actionable insights.
