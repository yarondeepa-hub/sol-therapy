I want to create a personal hook bank — a collection of opening lines and hooks I can reference when creating content.

Please help me build this:

1. First, read my brand context:
   - C-core/project-brief.md (what I do)
   - C-core/voice-dna.md (how I sound)
   - C-core/icp-profile.md (who I'm talking to)
   - B-brain/references/writing-samples/ (my actual content)

2. Analyze hooks from my existing content:
   - Extract the opening lines from my writing samples
   - Identify which patterns I naturally use
   - Note what works well in my voice

3. Create a Hook Bank organized by type:

   **Question Hooks:**
   - Open-ended questions that provoke thought
   - Rhetorical questions that challenge assumptions
   - "Have you ever..." pattern

   **Contrarian Hooks:**
   - Challenge conventional wisdom
   - "Unpopular opinion" format
   - "Everyone says X, but..."

   **Story Hooks:**
   - Personal experience openers
   - "Last week I..." format
   - Specific moment in time

   **Data/Number Hooks:**
   - Surprising statistics
   - Specific numbers that grab attention
   - "X% of people..." format

   **Bold Statement Hooks:**
   - Strong declarations
   - One-line truth bombs
   - Definitive statements

   **Curiosity Gap Hooks:**
   - Incomplete information that pulls readers in
   - "The one thing that..." format
   - Tease without revealing

4. For each hook type, provide:
   - 5 template structures I can fill in
   - 3 examples customized to my topics/niche
   - Tips for when to use this type

5. Create a quick-reference cheat sheet I can scan in 30 seconds

6. Save the Hook Bank to B-brain/references/hook-bank.md

7. Update M-memory/learning-log.md with insights about my hook patterns

Give me a comprehensive hook bank I can use every time I create content.
