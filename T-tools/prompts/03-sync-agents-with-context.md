# Prompt: Sync Agents with Your Core Files

Use this after you've filled in your brand core files to make sure all your agents are grounded in YOUR unique voice, business, and ideal customer.

I've filled in my brand core files. Now I need all my agents to read and internalize this information.

Please do the following:

1. First, read my completed core files:
   - C-core/project-brief.md (my business and what makes it unique)
   - C-core/voice-dna.md (how my brand speaks)
   - C-core/icp-profile.md (who I'm talking to)

2. Read all my agent files in the A-agents/ folder

3. For each agent, confirm:
   - Does the agent's "Required Reading" section point to my core files?
   - Does the agent understand my specific business, not generic placeholders?
   - Does the agent know my voice attributes and how to apply them?
   - Does the agent understand my ICP's pain points, language, and motivations?

4. Create a brief summary for me showing:
   - What you learned about my brand (key points from project-brief)
   - What you learned about my voice (key attributes from voice-dna)
   - What you learned about my audience (key insights from icp-profile)

5. If any agent files still have generic placeholders or instructions, let me know what needs updating.

6. Update the learning log (M-memory/learning-log.md) with an entry noting that all agents have been synced with my brand context.

After this, whenever I ask any agent to create content, they should automatically use my specific brand voice, speak to my specific audience, and reflect my unique positioning — not generic AI output.

Show me the summary and confirm all agents are now properly grounded in my brand.

## Why This Matters

Your agents are only as good as the context they have.

**Before syncing:** Agents write generic content that sounds like everyone else.

**After syncing:** Agents write content that sounds like YOU — specific to your business, your voice, your audience.

## When to Use This

- Right after filling in your core files for the first time
- Whenever you make significant updates to your brand positioning
- When content starts feeling generic or off-brand
- Before starting a big content project
