Please follow this process:

1. First, read the workflow in T-tools/workflows/linkedin-post-workflow.md to understand the process

2. Read my brand core:
   - C-core/project-brief.md
   - C-core/voice-dna.md
   - C-core/icp-profile.md
   - B-brain/references/writing-samples/ (if available)

3. Read the LinkedIn skill: T-tools/skills/linkedin-post-skill/linkedin-post-skill.md

4. Read what we've learned before: M-memory/learning-log.md

5. Now work as the Copywriter (A-agents/copywriter-agent.md):
   - Write a first draft
   - Create a new folder in O-output/ with the next available number
   - Save your draft as copywriter-draft.md with your notes about the choices you made

6. Then work as the Gatekeeper (A-agents/gatekeeper-agent.md):
   - Review the draft against all standards
   - Save your review as gatekeeper-review.md
   - If approved, create final-post.md ready to publish
   - If not approved, explain what needs to change

7. Update M-memory/learning-log.md with what you learned from this process

Show me the final result and tell me if it's ready to publish or needs revision.
```
