# Prompt: Convert Brand Discovery to Core Files

Copy and paste this into your chat:

---

```
Read my answers in B-brain/references/brand-discovery-worksheet.md and convert them into the three core files:

1. C-core/project-brief.md - fill in based on Part 1 (who we are, what problem we solve, what makes us different)
2. C-core/icp-profile.md - fill in based on Part 2 (ideal customer, their goals, obstacles, where they hang out)
3. C-core/voice-dna.md - fill in based on Part 3 (brand personality, what we're not, example sentences)

Keep the existing structure of each file, just replace the [placeholders] with my actual answers.
```
