# Prompt: Learn My Writing Style

Copy and paste this into your chat:

---

```
Read all the writing samples in B-brain/references/writing-samples/ and learn my writing style. Then:

1. Update C-core/voice-dna.md - add specific patterns you noticed (sentence length, tone, words I use, words I avoid, formatting habits)

2. Update A-agents/copywriter-agent.md - add a new section called "Owner's Writing Style" with concrete examples and patterns from my samples that the copywriter should follow

3. Update M-memory/learning-log.md - add an entry documenting what you learned about my style, with specific examples

Show me a summary of what you learned and what you updated.
```
