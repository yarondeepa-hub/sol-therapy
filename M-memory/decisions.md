# Decisions Log

Track key decisions you've made about your brand, content, and strategy — and why.

## Why Track Decisions

> "A decision without context is just a rule. A decision with context is wisdom."

When you or your agents revisit old decisions, you need to know:
- What you decided
- Why you decided it
- What you considered
- Whether it's still valid

This prevents:
- Re-debating settled issues
- Forgetting why you do things a certain way
- Inconsistent choices over time
