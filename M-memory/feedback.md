# Feedback Log

Track feedback on your content — what resonated, what didn't, and what your audience actually said.

---

## Why Track Feedback

> "Your audience teaches you how to serve them better."

Feedback is external signal. Unlike the learning-log (internal patterns), this captures:
- Comments on your posts
- DMs and replies
- Engagement patterns
- Direct audience input

---

## How to Use This File

**After publishing:** Log notable feedback
**Weekly:** Review for patterns
**Monthly:** Extract insights to learning-log
